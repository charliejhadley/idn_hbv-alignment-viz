=================

This repository is a placeholder for a Shiny app developed by the [University of Oxford's IDN](http://idn.it.ox.ac.uk) on behalf of [Dr. Philippa Matthews](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4036-4269) and [Jolynne Mokaya](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8398-0689).

This shiny app makes use of the [`gene.alignment.tables` visualisation library](https://github.com/martinjhnhadley/gene.alignment.tables). The underlying data for this specific visualisation is currently embargo but will be published to Figshare in the near future.
